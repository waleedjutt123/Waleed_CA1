    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>
      Originally written as a country song and intended to be a collaboration
      with Stevie Nicks, Prince explained the meaning of the song as follows:
      <em
        >"When there's blood in the sky... red and blue = purple. Purple rain
        pertains to the end of the world and being with the one you love and
        letting your faith/god guide you through the purple rain."</em
      >

    <h2>Recording</h2>
    <p>
      The song was recorded during a benefit concert for the Minnesota Dance
      Theatre at the First Avenue nightclub in Minneapolis on August 3, 1983.
      <em>City Pages</em> described the 70-minute performance as Prince's
      <em>"sweatiest and most soulful hometown concert yet."</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Reception and legacy</h2>
    <p>
      The song ranked number 144 on the Rolling Stone list of the 500 Greatest
